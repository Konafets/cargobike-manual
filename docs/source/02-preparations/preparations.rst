What is necessary to start a Commons Cargobike?
===============================================

For the start of a Commons Cargobike, high financial or human resources are not exactly necessary. Depending on the project requirements, the following is sufficient:

- one vision
- a team (a team (at least two motivated people))
- a name for the cargobike (each child needs a name)
- a cargobike
- a station
- a small initial marketingoutfit (photos of the cargobike, a website, a Facebook fanpage, flyer or sticker, if necessary)
- a booking system - ideally an online booking system, but at least one paper calendar at the station
- a person responsible for the maintenance of the cargobike

First of all, it is important to have a vision and supporter of the initiative – as the nucleus of the Commons Cargobike, so to speak. Tips on who can be a contender for your vision can be found in the chapter “Who can be a cooperation partner?”.
A good example of a project start with minimal equipment is Heinrich der Lastenlöwe from Braunschweig: With a name (Heinrich der Lastenlöwe) and a Wordpress webseite it started, in a second step it looked for financial and personnel support via the press and found it.

Basically, it will help you if you solve problems that arise the day after tomorrow. You can start right now - many problems will solve themselves and if not, you will find a solution.

Tip: Register with your initiative in our WIKI, especially if you don't have a logo, cargo bike or website yet - maybe you'll find some fellows. See instructions: Enter initiative.

Which goals and target groups are to be achieved with the project?
==================================================================

Before the start of the project, it is helpful to become clear about the aspirations and goals as well as target groups. Many other decisions in the project are influenced by this, e. g. the selection of the cargobike, the selection and number of stations or the communication channels.

What do you want to achieve with your project?
----------------------------------------------

We have, for example, sought to achieve the following very practical objectives:

- to make all possible uses of cargobikes experienceable
- to offer prospective buyers of cargo bikes the opportunity to make different cargo bikes available to try before purchasing them
- People who only need cargobikes once in a while to provide them and thus avoid unnecessary car journeys

In the field of transport and environmental policy, for example:

- Initiate or strengthen the presence of cargo bikes in the cityscape
- It works without a car! make the possibilities of using cargobikes visible
- The cycle path is too narrow, imagine Kasimir driving here! Establish the cargo bike as a brand and model for transport policy work.

Or this socio-political goal:

- Enable participation, e. g. for people without a driving licence or financial means

Maybe not as a project goal, but as a nice side effect the team of Hannah from Hannover has connected people in the city who are interested in bicycles and thus initiated the birth of a new local cycling scene.

Who do you want to reach with your project?

We wanted to and have e. g. to the following target groups:

- families
- initiatives
