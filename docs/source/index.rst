Welcome to commons cargobike handbook
=====================================

You're just starting a commons cargbike sharing project? Do you have any questions about the ongoing operation? You want to know how others do it? Then you've come to the right place. On the following pages, many existing initiatives have gathered and edited their experiences to help you in all phases of the project.

Of course, there is not "the one way" to implement a commons cargobike, and our community thrives due to the different approaches and implementations. Therefore, this manual can never be complete, on the contrary: it just waits for your ideas, additions and corrections.

Many thanks to the ADFC Bundesverband, who supported us with the initial compilation of the Handbook 2017, the cargonomia in Budapest for the translation and to all those who have worked with us!

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
